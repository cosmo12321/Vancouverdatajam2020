# Vancouverdatajam2020
Vancouver Datajam 2020 is an exciting, new event that includes multiple data-oriented coding groups in a collaborative attempt to gain knowledge in R and Python. The scope of this event is to extend the grassroots theme of many of our existing groups and create a small (50 participants), intimate, and engaging environment for our existing members to work through an entire data analysis workflow. This 1-day event will include two separate 3.5 hour tutorials on R and Python, followed by  a mini 4-hour hack where hackers exercise what they've learned in teams. A dinner and networking event including panelists will be held for the hackers at the end of the day. Since the event will be held in March, we are in the early stages of planning but would like to focus on introducing women from academia and industry into data wrangling and build their confidence in statistics and data science.
